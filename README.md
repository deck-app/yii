# YII 2
## Introduction
Yii is an open source, object-oriented, component-based MVC PHP web application framework. Yii is pronounced as "Yee" or [ji:] and in Chinese it means "simple and evolutionary" and it can be an acronym for "Yes It Is!"

## Getting started
The quickest way to get started with the Deck Yii2 Development Container is using docker-compose.

Begin by creating a directory for your Yii2 application:
```
mkdir ~/myapp
cd ~/myapp
```
Clone the application directory:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/deck-app/yii.git
$ cd yii
```
Finally launch the Laravel application development environment using:
```
$ docker-compose up -d
```
